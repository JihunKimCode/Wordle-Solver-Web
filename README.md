# What is this website?
Using the Bayesian Algorithm, make a model to play [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). The Bayesian model can find the target word in 3.87 on average.
So that you know, this website does not include the training and testing phase. This is only for the main game.
